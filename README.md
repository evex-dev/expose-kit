## Concept
JavaScript deobfuscation tools are everywhere.  
But many of them are **too aggressive**, rewriting code until it breaks.  

<img width="654" height="24" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd11d250-0163-4cd2-b36c-5514137fe087" />

Expose Kit takes a different path.

Instead of brute force, it works **step by step**.

The goal is simple: **safe and universal toolkit**.

Alongside deobfuscation, Expose Kit includes a collection of practical utilities.  
Everything you need is documented right here in this [README](README.md).
