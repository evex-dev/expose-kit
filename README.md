Many *tools* currently exist, but most of them perform dangerous transformations and **break the code**.

With *this tool*, we aim to minimize the possibility of code breakage by step-by-step performing individual tasks
such as *safely separating scopes* and *expanding string tables* and more.

Additionally, we offer various other useful tools. Everything is written in this [README](README.md).
