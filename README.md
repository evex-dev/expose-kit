## Concept
JavaScript deobfuscation tools are everywhere.  
But many of them are **too aggressive**, rewriting code until it breaks.

Expose Kit takes a different path.

Instead of brute force, it works **step by step**:
- safely isolating scopes  
- gently expanding string tables  
- transforming only what *should* be transformed  

The goal is simple: **clarity without destruction**.

Alongside deobfuscation, Expose Kit includes a collection of practical utilities.  
Everything you need is documented right here in this [README](README.md).

## Installation
